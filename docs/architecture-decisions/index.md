# Architecture Decision Records

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement
that is architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a
measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a
single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes. The collection of ADRs created and
maintained in a project constitute its decision log.
