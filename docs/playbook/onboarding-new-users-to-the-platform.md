## Prerequisites

- You need to be a manager of the relevant Google group
- The user you would like to add to the Google group has a Hackney GSuite account

### Adding a user to that group

- To add a user to a Google group, follow the instructions [here][add_user_google_group]
- This can take up to two hours to sync with AWS
