## What is a data platform?

A data platform is an integrated technology solution that allows data located in different data sources to be governed, accessed, and delivered to users, applications, or other technologies. Our data platform is composed of a number of different elements:

- __A Data Lake__: this is a centralised repository to store data all in one place, and a set of loosely coupled processes to ingest data into the lake, transform it, and publish/connect that data out to other tools.


- __A Data Catalogue__: this is a place to store documentation and metadata about the datasets within the data lake. It helps users discover what data exists, understand what the data mean, and find out who owns the data.
- __A Data Warehouse__: this is a store of 'gold standard' data that is ready for analysis or publication. It is the result of processes to ingest, clean and transform data in the data lake.
- __A Data Dictionary__: this defines domain-driven design entities and their relationships to one another at a high level. (For example, how a 'person' relates to a 'household', 'property', etc.)
- __This Playbook__: this playbook provides step-by-step guidance about how to use the platform, along with technical documentation about how the platform has been set up and decisions we've made.


## Why a data platform?

Our vision for Hackney's data platform is to ‘build back better’ for the future and deliver a secure, scalable, reusable cloud-based data infrastructure that brings together the council’s key data assets. This will enable us to democratise access to data (where appropriate), use technology to enable deeper insight, and derive greater value from our data to improve the lives of residents.

__We want to democratise data across the council:__
- People can find the data they need
- People know how to get access to the data they need
- People understand the content and context of the data
- People can access and manipulate data through a range of tools that meet their needs
- People have access to the skills, tools and learning resources they need
- Data is available to both people and systems to gain operational value
- Ownership of the platform is shared across the council

__We want our platform to be secure:__
- People can only access what they should
- People can request access to data through a central, governed process
- Information Asset Owners can make informed decisions about who gets access through a simple process
- Data is minimised, anonymised and segmented so that access can be as wide as possible
- The platform meets statutory requirements and best practice for storing and moving data

__We want reusable and scalable processes to promote stability and reduce duplication:__
- We use open technologies where possible to prevent vendor lock-in and widen the possibilities of reuse
- People can easily share and reuse each other's work
- Processes are automated wherever possible to enable people to focus on higher value tasks
- Processes are tested and dependable
- We apply consistent standards and conventions across datasets and processes

__We want the platform to enable deeper insight:__
- People have access to the tools they need to apply and productionse advanced analytics
- We can perform cross-cutting analysis to develop insight across services

## Processing data through the platform

There are a series of processes data will go through as it moves through the platform:

1. Ingesting data: 
2. Transforming data:
3. Analysing data:
4. Publishing and distributing:

## Why a Playbook?

## Our Playbook journey

## Who this Playbook is for

Each section has different audiences:

- __About__ - Anybody who will work with or on the data platform
- __Playbook__ - Analysts, and engineers looking to consume and manipulate data on the Data Platform
- __Technical Documentation, Architecture Decision__ - Engineers working on improving the platform

## Help us improve
We are always looking at ways we can improve. If you have any ideas or suggestions please share your feedback on our playbook [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/Data-Platform-Playbook).
